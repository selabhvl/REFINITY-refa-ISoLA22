Another area of interest for equivalence is replacing one data structure with another,
e.g.\ Fowler's \cite{needed}\vsnote{TODO: @Ole, I'm sure Fowler had something, can you check please?}.
As an example, in the following we look at a piece of code where an array is replaced with an object (or vice versa).
Again, from the strict default perspective of ``equal return values, equal heaps'', any two programs using the data structures are obviously not equal.
Encoding observability as per the previous section will obviously solve this issue, as the observables would ideally talk about the constituent parts.

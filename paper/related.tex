Similar or other approaches to formal verification of refactorings can be found in work by
Garrido et. al. \cite{garrido2006formal} who formalize \emph{``Push Down Method''},
\emph{``Pull Up Field''} and \emph{``Rename Temporary''} using an executable
Java formal semantics in Maude and give partially mechanized proofs for the two former.

Long Quan et. al. \cite{DBLP:conf/isola/QuanQL08} formulate refactorings as refinement
laws in the calculus of refinement of component and object-oriented systems (rCOS),
focusing on correctnes proofs of refactoring rules themselves.

While KeY and REFINITY is unique for its relational verification capacity for
schematic programs (or abstract programs) it is limited in power for verification
of concrete programs relying much more on manual specification or interaction \cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/Steinhofel20}
than tools like LLReÌ‚ve \cite{DBLP:journals/jar/KieferKU18} or SymDiff \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/LahiriHKR12}
which offer more automation for concrete programs.

% What we want
% Talk about the renaming issue (identify in which cases it's interesting)
% Talk about relational verification
% For NPEs:
%  1. several ways to specify whether two objs. are equiv., need to decide that equiv!
%  2. Observables, if observ. are event-like then we can do it a history variable (as in KeY-ABS) otherwise we need symbolic-traces
% 3. For e.g. the array coordinate problem we need relational invariants in addition to relational postconditions (see mathias paper?)

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Relational verification through dynamic logic is a promising approach for verification of object oriented programs.
Recent advances from symbolic to abstract executions have enabled reasoning about incomplete/abstract versions of such programs.
This has proven fruitful in the exploration of correctness of refactorings primarily related to code blocks in Java.
In this paper we explore further types of equivalent transformations and refactorings and discuss the challenges that still
need to be overcome for full round-trip correctness of refactorings in object-oriented languages.

\section{Challenges}\label{sec:challenges}
In this section we explore the possibilities of \Refinity{} beyond the original work.
In particular, we are interested in moving away from statement-based refactorings to more complex changes that also affect the structure of the code.
The first new refactoring, Hide Delegate, harnesses Java inner classes to express the desired behaviour of \Refinity{} in a straight-forward manner
and KeY automatically completes the proof once the right preconditions are identified.

After that, we present a refactoring that is related to Dead Code Elimination.
This requires introduction of additional constructs for object-construction within KeY,
which are then harnessed in tactlets that express that certain non-identical heaps guarantee equivalent behaviour.

We continue our wishlist for further flexibility in expressing equivalent program behaviour based on the execution history of user-defined observable actions,
and finally discuss challenges related to expressing equivalence in the face of different data types.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

\begin{itemize}
\item formal proofs of correctness for OO program optimisation
\item formal proofs of OO refactoring
\item check Dominic's thesis and papers for the relevant related work
\item important: correctness on actual Java, not something which looks like Java
\item also: correctness with respect to OO features
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}


\paragraph{Future Work.} 
To investigate the discussed problems with refactoring using AE w.r.t.\ trace properties, we are currently implementing AE for BPL in the Crowbar tool~\cite{crowbar} as a starting point.

Succinctly, exactly as stated by Steinfh√∂fel in their Ph.D. thesis, ``Abstract Execution'' denotes the idea to process abstract programs by symbolic execution (SE)~\cite{steinhoefel-20}.
SE~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/BaldoniCDDF18,DBLP:journals/ac/YangFBCW19} abstracts concrete execution by means of symbolic representations of language runtime
state in place of concrete machine representations of such artefacts.
Thus, e.g., values, a store or a program counter all have a symbolic representation in SE.
Branching points, such as encountered when symbolically executing e.g., an if-then-else statement splits an execution path into new paths for each possible branch arm, and for each such
path e.g., the symbolic store may be preserved in the new paths, but different conditions may also be carried through such that in the path where the symbolic program counter refers
to the then branch the evaluation of the boolean expression in the if statement must be valid whereas it is not valid in the path where the symbolic program counter refers to the else branch.
Possible executions are not just captured through branching paths, but along a path itself through the symbolic store; a symbolic value represents any valid concrete substitution.

The SE found in KeY and \Refinity{} operate on a dynamic logic JavaDL, for a restricted subset of Java.
Syntactically JavaDL is an extension of first-order logic with program variables and program modalities.
Semantically JavaDL formulas are not evaluated in a Kripke structure
over a collection of first-order structures \cite{DBLP:series/lncs/10001}.

The use of SE to potentially explore every possible execution a program can have is a popular program analysis technique. AE extends SE by
introducing abstract program elements (APEs) to the base language that is symbolically executed.
For statements and expressions a corresponding abstract statement and abstract expression are introduced.
APEs represent any possible substitution with concrete program elements, be it statements or expressions, from the base language being symbolically executed.
Execution of APEs is then the leap taken in AE over traditional SE and requires the introduction of abstract state changes, SE branching for
any abrupt completion an APE may have (e.g. exceptions thrown),
over-approximation of returned values and thrown exceptions by symbols created ``dependently fresh'' for identifiers of abstract program placeholders and a way to specify the behavior of APEs ~\cite{steinhoefel-20}.

\OA{We summarize how AE is implemented in \Refinity{} by showing how to specify a method \rcode{void n()} with largely unknown method body content.
We want to specify it can possibly assign to some abstract locations (its frame), access some abstract locations (its footprint) and that no exceptions will be thrown by the method body.
We achieve such a specification in \Refinity{} by supplying it a definition of \rcode{n()} as seen in Listing \ref{lst:ExtractVariable-refinity-method}.
A method is specified and its only content is an abstract statement \rcode{\\abstract\_statement N;} preceded by a Java Modelling Language (JML) like\footnote{we say ``like'' as JML does not deal with abstract Java programs} specification~\cite{HuismanAhrendtBruns2014_1000041881} for it embedded in the comment (every line in the comment beginning with a \rcode{@}-character).
The specification is straightforward with no surprises: Abstract statement \rcode{N} may assign to the abstract location set \rcode{frN}, access the abstract location set \rcode{fpN} and may not throw any exceptions.}

An abstract location set represents a fixed set of memory locations a program may read or write to.
The set is fixed through a program's duration but the values at these locations may change.
When an abstract location set is placed in an assignable or accessible specification it is to be understood as an upper bound;
the locations may possibly all be accessed or assigned to, not at all or anything in between.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item in the following, we show a simple example for AE where we prove a new refactoring correct with REFINITY
%\item with AE, we can specify a fully abstract method $n()$ (abstract body, explain locationsets, frame/footprint, global AE constraints -- do not specialise for Extract LV yet).
%\item And now we can formulate the equivalence-question in Refinity with a before/after. Point out condition under which this is not correct,
%\item the first attempt fails with open goals (give interpretation of open goal)
%\item add AE-constraint to make the example go through
%\item 1-2 sentences on ``instantiation-problem'', i.e. avoid giving specs that can't be implemented (example: assignable nothing) although technically Dom covered this already.
%\end{itemize}

In the following, we show an example of how AE can be used to prove a refactoring correct with \Refinity{}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Challenge: be careful in encoding, since currently LHS and RHS share classes and methods.
\item Adressing this would essentially require choosing unique names on LHS and RHS, since they go into a single KeY-proof, and hence would require some form of mapping objects between both sides.
\item Challenge: capturing the most general instance of a pattern (example: Extract Local Variable, with the duplicate call to \texttt{n()}).
\item For example for HD, we need to have two cases, one with fields, in addition to the one with local vars.
\item We feel that often pre-conditions on a refactoring can easily be discharged by simple syntactical or static analysis (e.g. ``code does never read attribute $x$ of objects of type $C$'').
Yet unlike in other formal work where the program is encoded as part of the proof-term, we cannot implement such analyses within KeY, and can only informally document and require such side-conditions on refactorings.
